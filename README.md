# AI-game-bot

  This is my first original project, even though it is a collaboration. The goal is to make a very simple web game that an AI bot can play. The game is very simple, with it only being 3 buttons on the screen. One of the buttons will be a different color, which is the button that needs to be clicked to gain a "point". Once you do that, another button will become the button of a different color, needing to be clicked. This proccess will continue forever randomly. To go along with this, we are going to make a bot with AI that will be able to play the game. We were thinking of also expanding the game to be more of a user friendly, multiplayer, and competitive game that could be played by the average person, creating some way for it to become progressively harder, although this would be focusing more on the game than the AI part of the project, but that could definitely be a possibility.
  
  I am very new to programming, this project being my first exposure to github or even some languages like javascript. My collaborator and I are trying to keep this as a learning experience, and are trying to figure things out ourselves as we go, although help is always welcome. Our goal for learning is to understand more about AI, web development, and how python or other languages interact with html and webpages. Although it is not something that solves any problem, I think that it is a good first project to learn how to inegrate and use different languages.
